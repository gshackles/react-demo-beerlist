# react-demo-beerlist

[![CI status](https://travis-ci.org/gshackles/react-demo-beerlist.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/gshackles/react-demo-beerlist)

Super simple React demo app that queries [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/). You'll need to add your API key to `src/api/SearchService.js`.

Primary gulp tasks:
- `gulp watch`: build and launch with live reloading enabled
- `gulp build`: build in production mode

Both tasks will build the site into the `dist/` folder.
